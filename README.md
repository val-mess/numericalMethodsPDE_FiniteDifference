# numericalMethodsPDE_FiniteDifference
In this project, we used finite difference method to approximate the solutions of the elliptic, heat and transport PDE in dimension 1. For these use cases, different schemes have been tested : left-sided, right-sided and centered schemes.

You will find a .pdf report, an .mlx (Matlab) main file and some useful functions (.m files).
